After completing the book <u>Full Body Burden: Growing Up in the Nuclear Shadow of Rocky Flats</u> by Kristen Iversen, and having had a couple of days for it to simmer in the back of my mind, here is my discussion on the book.


Firstly, my thoughts on the book as a whole: <u>Full Body Burden</u> is an enjoyable and easy read, and is definitely a book I'd recommend to aspiring and existing scientists and engineers. These are people that already hold profound and firsthand understanding on the positive impacts of science and engineering through infrastructure and services that reach far and wide. But we don't often get much firsthand historical account when it comes to what has happened in the muddier, more morally grey areas of technological advancement, which have existed forever and will continue to emerge in relevant fields such as weapons tech, general energy, general artificial intelligence, CRISPR, robotics, and more. These technologies have prompted and will always prompt both breathless predictions of societal breakthroughs and countless warnings of apocalypse.


As a foreword and introductory exposition, without spoiling too much of the book, <u>Full Body Burden</u> is a book about Rocky Flats, a Department of Energy facility in Colorado managed by Dow Chemical, and subsequently, Rockwell International. This facility primarily manufactured plutonium pucks, which serve as the trigger to the secondary, much more powerful blast in a nuclear weapon. These triggers were made for the US nuclear weapons arsenal throughout the 1950s and for the rest of the Cold-War and 20th century. The book is Iversen's historical recounting, pointed analysis, and criticism of the facility management's massive degree of neglect, mishandling, and public misinformation campaign, as well as serving as a sort of autobiography on the part of Iversen about what life was like for her growing up in Arvada, Colorado in close proximity to the Rocky Flats facility.


As an offhand remark, I should note that the story of Rocky Flats reminds me tremendously of that of the Hawkins Lab in the fictitious TV show series, Stranger Things. Except instead of bringing a girl with superpowers and an alternate mirror dimension in the backdrop of the MKUltra trials, Rocky Flats brought instead, cancer and other life-long health issues to its workers and Colorado residents close to the facility. It also contaminated swathes of land from illegal plutonium incineration, creating fields and forests that will be unusable for several millennia, all in the name of maintaining the upper hand in the arms race - at <i>whatever</i> cost.


It is also very interesting to me that Rocky Flats isn't a more well known case, despite the obvious secrecy by the government, since us Americans seem to be the very same people to easily point the finger at Russia for the very same neglect, mishandling, and disinformation they engaged in during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Though I will concede that, given the evidence, Chernobyl had the much larger negative impact, permanently displacing 300,000 residents, and impacting millions more.


To provide further context to my analysis and reading, this book was assigned to me as a part of University of Michigan's College of Engineering course ENGR 110 discussion class.


Due to this, I strongly believe that this book was assigned in large part to illustrate to us the far and wide reaching impact of our very own engineering as we progress through college and beyond into research or industry. To me, that is most obviously the desired response to reading this book. The less obvious conclusion that I have arrived at would be that throughout our engineering endeavors, the moralization of our work is never so simple, but the onus is nonetheless on us to moralize it, and to justify it at least to ourselves.


However, that last statement comes with a massive asterisk of a caveat.  Justification is not to be confused with the justification from the group, or from those in power, or from various other forms of groupthink and group consciousnesses. It is never an easy path to tread when it comes to social creatures that can collectively hold vastly different values from another collective. If not us, then Germany during WWII, or Russia during the Cold War, would justify nuclear arms, as we all did in the end, in the name of extreme nationalism; the maintaining of the State no holds barred. The fact stands that nuclear weapons technology exists, and the possibility for the technology existed before any one Sapien had come up with the concept, so it was purely a matter of time. What I mean by all this is that it's very easy to take up the position that nuclear weapons should've never come into existence in the first place, however, that is too retrospective, and there's nothing we can do about changing the past practically.

The reality is that nuclear weaponry was most likely an inevitability, as are the many technologies projected to exist within our future. The questions we must ask, then, for every one of our creations, are about its morality. It is the engineers duty to ask the questions before the technology's advent, during its implementation, while being managed, and perhaps even when it's too late. This is best done completely free of political baggage, which is unfortunately extremely difficult, as the State often has an excruciating amount of monetary influence when it comes to the research.

The classic case of this in the engineering world, coincidentally in the same field, is of course of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the oft-quoted and perhaps most famous of the Manhattan Project engineers. At his farewell ceremony from the Los Alamos Lab, Oppenheimer speculated that if atomic bombs were to become a regular part of war, then "mankind will curse the names of Los Alamos and Hiroshima." Even more famously, Oppenheimer confided in President Harry Truman that he felt that he had blood on his hands.

In the years that followed the dropping of the atomic bombs, much was said about the need for new leadership behind the research, production, and regulation of the technology. Along with the uncertainty the scientists had regarding the appropriateness of using the nuclear weapons was the uncertainty that that power belonged in the hands of the government. As such, some of these scientists joined and formed the Federation of Atomic Scientists in 1945 and pushed for civilian control of nuclear research and production. These scientists thought it was the scientists, not the policymakers, who were the best stewards for the technology and that a change in this leadership would allow them to make things better.

As it stood in <u>Full Body Burden</u>, the implementation and management of the nuclear weapon technology in the Rocky Flats facility fell under the purview of the Dow Chemical company, and later the Rockwell International group, both of which were overseen by the Department of Energy, an executive department, which contributed to much of the cover up of the mismanagement in order to protect state interests, rather than the public interest. A civilian oversight committee came far too late to do anything substantial, and the facility would have likely massively benefitted from an engineer and scientist committee.
