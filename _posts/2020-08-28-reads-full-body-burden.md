After completing the book <u>Full Body Burden: Growing Up in the Nuclear Shadow of Rocky Flats</u> by Kristen Iversen, and having had a couple of days for it to simmer in the back of my mind, here is my discussion on the book.


Firstly, my thoughts on the book as a whole: <u>Full Body Burden</u> is an enjoyable and easy read, and is definitely a book I'd recommend to aspiring and existing scientists and engineers. These are people that already hold profound and firsthand understanding on the positive impacts of science and engineering through infrastructure and services that reach far and wide. But we don't often get much firsthand historical account when it comes to what has happened in the muddier, more morally grey areas of technological advancement, which have existed forever and will continue to emerge in relevant fields such as weapons tech, general energy, general artificial intelligence, CRISPR, robotics, and more. These technologies have prompted and will always prompt both breathless predictions of societal breakthroughs and countless warnings of apocalypse.


As a foreword and introductory exposition, without spoiling too much of the book, <u>Full Body Burden</u> is a book about Rocky Flats, a Department of Energy facility in Colorado managed by Dow Chemical, and subsequently, Rockwell International. This facility primarily manufactured plutonium pucks, which serve as the trigger to the secondary, much more powerful blast in a nuclear weapon. These triggers were made for the US nuclear weapons arsenal throughout the 1950s and for the rest of the Cold-War and 20th century. The book is Iversen's historical recounting, pointed analysis, and criticism of the facility management's massive degree of neglect, mishandling, and public misinformation campaign, as well as serving as a sort of autobiography on the part of Iversen about what life was like for her growing up in Arvada, Colorado in close proximity to the Rocky Flats facility.


As an offhand remark, I should humorously note that the story of Rocky Flats reminds me tremendously of that of the Hawkins Lab in the fictitious TV show series, Stranger Things. Except instead of bringing a girl with superpowers and an alternate mirror dimension in the backdrop of the MKUltra trials, Rocky Flats brought instead, cancer, other life-long health issues, and contaminated land that will be unusable for millennia, all in the name of maintaining the upper hand in the arms race. At <i>whatever</i> cost.


It is also very interesting to me that Rocky Flats isn't a more well known case, despite the obvious secrecy by the government, since us Americans seem to be the very same people to point the finger at Russia for the very same neglect, mishandling, and disinformation they engaged in during the Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Though I will concede that, given the evidence, Chernobyl had the much larger negative impact, permanently displacing 300,000 residents, and impacting millions more.


To provide further context to my analysis and reading, this book was assigned to me as a part of University of Michigan's College of Engineering course ENGR 110 discussion class.


Due to this, I strongly believe that this book was assigned in large part to illustrate to us the far and wide reaching impact of our very own engineering as we progress through college and beyond into research or industry. To me, that is most obviously the desired response to reading this book. The less obvious conclusion that I have arrived at would be that throughout our engineering endeavors, the moralization of our work is never so simple, but the onus is nonetheless on us to moralize it, and to justify it at least to ourselves.


However, that last statement comes with a massive asterisk of a caveat.  Justification to the self is not to be confused with the justification from the group, or those in power, or various other forms of groupthink and group consciousness. It is not an easy path to tread when it comes to social creatures that can collectively hold different values from another collective. If not us, then Germany during WWII, or Russia during the Cold War, would justify nuclear arms, as we all did in the end, in the name of extreme nationalism; the maintaining of the State no holds barred. The fact stands that nuclear technology exists, and the possibility for the technology existed before any one Sapien had come up with the concept, so it was purely left up to time. What I mean by all this is that it's very easy to take up the position that nuclear weapons should've never come into existence in the first place, however, that is too retrospective, and there's nothing we can do about changing the past practically. The reality is that it was most likely an inevitability. The question then becomes: is it the responsibility on us as engineers then, to protest even when we have made the technology itself, perhaps even when it's too late?


The classic and well known case of this in the engineering world, uncoincidentally in the same exact field, is of course of J. Robert Oppenheimer, the oft-quoted and perhaps most famous of the Manhattan Project engineers. At his farewell ceremony from the Los Alamos Lab, Oppenheimer speculated that if atomic bombs were to become a regular part of war, then "mankind will curse the names of Los Alamos and Hiroshima." Even more famously, Oppenheimer confided in President Harry Truman that he felt that he had blood on his hands.
