<div>
    Hi! I am rising freshman at University of Michigan, Ann Arbor (UMich) majoring in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS). <br /><br/>


    I am a 17 year old Undergraduate student studying at UM, and one of my lifelong passions is to become the best robotics engineer that I can be. In order to accomplish this, I've spent my middle school and high school years designing robots and working alongside excellent mentors and peers and some of the best and brightest in competitive robotics to create some of my proudest achievements. I am also of many other passions, including Digital Imaging as well as Digital Photography. <br /><br/>


    After graduation, I plan to pursue roles that allow me to tackle challenging problems in robotics and control systems. I'm always looking for more opportunities to put my experiences into practical use and develop more skills to become a stronger problem solver and engineer. If you have anything in mind, please feel free to reach out to me via email at justinyu@umich.edu! <br /><br/>


    Full resume can be given by request.
