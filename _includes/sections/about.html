    Hi! I am rising junior at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) double majoring in Computer Science/Economics. <br /><br/>


    I have both SWE and research experience in the optimization of software infrastructure and cloud computing systems. Last summer, I worked as a software engineering intern in a bioinformatics group of a Caltech professor. One of my proudest accomplishments as an intern was building a full-stack web application with a client-server architecture in mind to predict cell segmentation and trajectory across frames and enable human-in-the-loop annotation of cell lineages. This tool enabled the group to crowdsource >3000 live-cell frame annotations for training state-of-the-art deep learning tracking models. This was an incredible experience learning about power of efficient systems infrastructure and algorithmic models to optimize operations for engineers and industry analysts. As a result, this summer, I sought an algorithmic intern fellowship under a renowned computing systems research group at Caltech to use scheduling and queuing theory to design sophisticated mathematical models that allocate tasks for large-scale ML cloud platform machines while optimizing for energy usage and performance. This work has had tremendous success in producing the first performance bound results in the area, and a paper is currently in process that details the novel algorithms that I constructed for this project. <br /><br/>


    After graduation, I plan to pursue roles that allow me to tackle challenging problems in distributed systems, cloud infrastructure, or economic markets with an algorithmic performance optimization component. I'm always looking for more opportunities to put my experiences into practical use and develop more skills to become a stronger problem solver and engineer. If you have anything in mind, either during the school year or summer, please feel free to reach out to me via email at jannie@caltech.edu! <br /><br/>
