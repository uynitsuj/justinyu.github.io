    Hi! I am an EECS freshman at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in the College of Engineering. <br /><br/>


    I am an aspiring robotics engineer from San Diego, California. In order to accomplish this, I've spent my middle school and high school years designing robots and working alongside excellent mentors and peers and some of the best and brightest in competitive robotics to create some of my proudest achievements. I am also currently pursuing a BSE in Electrical Engineering in the University of Michigan's College of Engineering. I am also of many other passions, including digital imaging as well as digital photography, mountain biking, surfing, traveling, and hiking. <br /><br/>


    After graduation, I plan to pursue either research or industry roles that allow me to tackle challenging problems in robotics and control systems or in the development of robotic actuators. I'm always looking for more opportunities to put my experiences into practical use and develop more skills to become a stronger problem solver and engineer. If you have anything in mind, please feel free to reach out to me via email at yujustin@umich.edu! <br /><br/>
