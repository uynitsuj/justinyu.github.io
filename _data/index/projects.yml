- name: 6DoF 3D-Printed Robotic Arm
  descr: "Personal Project over the 2020 Coronavirus Quarantine. Robot Control Interface is built from scratch in python using TKinter module with imbedded matplotlib mplot3d so that I could teach myself forward and inverse kinematics on a 6DoF robot arm. Robot uses NEMA 17 stepper motors for every joint besides the 2nd, where a NEMA 23 and a larger controller is necessary for greater torque. Robot control is completely open-loop. Serial data is sent over USB in order to prepare motor movement and execution commands using my custom control protocol. The basis for my custom Arduino sketch comes from iforce2d's Coordinated Stepper Movement Arduino Sketch. And my Over-Serial command protocol integrated into my Custom Arduino sketch comes from educ8s.tv. Tools: Solidworks, Python, Arduino IDE"

- name: 2019 FRC Robot - Gromit
  descr: "Affiliation: Head of Mechanical Design and Fabrication for Team 3128, the Aluminum Narwhals.
  Dimensions: 28&#34; W x 32&#34; L x 48&#34; H
  Weight: 119.8 lbs
  Top Speed: 10.5 mph
  Gromit has an extremely reliable and robust two stage continuous elevator, fashioning a virtual four bar linkage as the inner carriage on which both the cargo intake and the hatch panel intake are integrated. The polycarbonate cargo intake consists of wide top and bottom rollers allowing Gromit to secure cargo upon contact. The polycarbonate hatch intake consists of a pin-and-slot swiveling finger with a pusher tab allowing for hatch pickup and dropoff at unforgiving angles and horizontal displacements. The reverse 2 CIM gearboxes situated in the rear feature integrated “heely” wheels that come into contact with the ground when the robot tips backwards, allowing for control during the climbing sequence which utilizes two large pistons in the front and a rack and pinion system in the back. Gromit ranked 1st seed alliance at Monterey Bay Regional and advanced to become, for the first time in team history, an Alliance Captain at the FRC World Championship in Houston.
