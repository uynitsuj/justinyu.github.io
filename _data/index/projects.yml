- name: 6DoF 3D-Printed Robotic Arm
  descr: "Personal Project over the 2020 Coronavirus Quarantine. Robot Control Interface is built from scratch in python using TKinter module with imbedded matplotlib mplot3d so that I could teach myself forward and inverse kinematics on a 6DoF robot arm. Robot uses NEMA 17 stepper motors for every joint besides the 2nd, where a NEMA 23 and a larger controller is necessary for greater torque. Robot control is completely open-loop. Serial data is sent over USB in order to prepare motor movement and execution commands using my custom control protocol. The basis for my custom Arduino sketch comes from iforce2d's Coordinated Stepper Movement Arduino Sketch. And my Over-Serial command protocol integrated into my Custom Arduino sketch comes from educ8s.tv. Tools: Solidworks, Python, Arduino IDE"
